# EPL-ML-Project

## ML Project to predict outcome of home team using various models.

This data set represents information gathered about matches played in the English Premier League from the 2006/07 to 2018/19 seasons. 
This data set offers insight into the common trends and patterns of winning teams and hopefully, we can uncover a winning formula, 
or game performances of teams that are successful. Each row represents one match and contains the following columns for a Home and Away team:

-Home Team

-Away Team

-Total Number of Tackles
-Total Number of Clearances
-Total Number of Corners
-Total Number of Yellow Cards
-Total Number of Red Cards
-Total Number of Fouls
-Winner
-Match Week
-Season

For the Winner column, 0 represents a Tie, 1 represents a Home Team Win, 2 represents an Away Team Win.

0 = Tie
1 = Home Team Win
2 = Away Team Win
